## Introduction ##
GenScalpel is a program designed for specified-sequence retrieval and extraction from large-scale sequence sets in NCBI GenBank flatfile format. This routine task in bioinformatics analysis is a pressing need for laboratory biologists. Another objective of application development is to respond to the new form of the NCBI Nucleotide Sequence Database, which was updated in last November. In addition to a powerful sequence refinement application, GenScalpel provides convenient functions for web-based sequence downloading and multiple files batch-processing. The program is written in PERL 5.12.4 with a stable graphical user interface (GUI). It provides the user with a friendly window and menus environment for sequence assembly and analysis
